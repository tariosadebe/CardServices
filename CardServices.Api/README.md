# CardServices

**CardServices** is a backend API for managing and processing card-related data. This system is designed to handle the creation, management, and transaction of cards like credit/debit cards, gift cards, and loyalty cards. Built with ASP.NET Core, the application follows a multi-project architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and security.

## Features

- **Card Issuance**: Users can request new cards with specific details such as type, limits, and cardholder information.
- **Transaction Management**: The system tracks card transactions including deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and purchases.
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Supports external payment provider integration like Visa, MasterCard, or PayPal.
- **Security and Fraud Detection**: Incorporates security mechanisms to protect user data and detect fraudulent activity.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage users, approve transactions, and monitor card activities.

## Project Structure

The system is divided into multiple projects for better modularity and separation of concerns:

1. **CardAPI** - The main Web API that exposes endpoints for managing cards, transactions, etc.
2. **CardService** - Contains business logic for card issuance, transaction processing, etc.
3. **UserManagement** - Manages user authentication, registration, and access control.
4. **PaymentGateway** - Integrates with external payment providers for transaction processing.
5. **TransactionHistory** - Handles data storage for card transactions and logs.
6. **Shared** - Common utilities such as models, DTOs, and validation logic.
7. **AdminPortal** - Admin dashboard for managing users and transactions.
8. **FraudDetection** - Service to monitor and detect fraudulent activities based on transaction patterns.
9. **Testing** - Unit and integration tests to ensure proper functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core** - For building the backend API.
- **Entity Framework Core** - For database interactions.
- **JWT Authentication** - For secure and token-based user authentication.
- **SQL Server** - For storing card and transaction data.
- **External Payment Gateways** - Integrations with third-party payment processors (Visa, MasterCard, PayPal).
- **Unit Testing** - Using xUnit and Moq for writing tests.

## How It Works

1. **Card Issuance**: The **CardAPI** project exposes an endpoint for creating cards. The request includes card details and user information. The **CardService** handles the business logic for card creation, while the **TransactionHistory** logs each transaction.
   
2. **Transactions**: When users make a transaction, the **TransactionService** validates the action and communicates with the **PaymentGateway** to process the payment. The transaction is then logged.

3. **User Management**: The **UserManagement** project provides endpoints for registering, authenticating, and authorizing users. It uses JWT tokens for secure access to the system.

4. **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can use the **AdminPortal** to review transactions, approve card issuance, and monitor fraud detection alerts.

5. **Fraud Detection**: The **FraudDetection** service continuously monitors transaction patterns to identify potentially fraudulent activities.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- .NET 6.0 or higher
- SQL Server
- Any external payment providers if needed (e.g., Visa, PayPal)

### Steps to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CardServices.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CardServices
   ```

3. Restore the NuGet packages:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. Set up your `.env` file with appropriate variables (e.g., database connection string, payment gateway keys, etc.).

5. Update the database schema (if necessary):
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

6. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

The API will now be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Documentation

### Endpoints

- **POST /cards** - Create a new card.
- **POST /transactions** - Perform a transaction (deposit, withdrawal, transfer, etc.).
- **GET /cards/{id}** - Retrieve card details by card ID.
- **GET /cards/user/{userId}** - Get all cards for a particular user.

For detailed API documentation, you can use Swagger, which is automatically enabled when running the application.
